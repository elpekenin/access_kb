Access keyboard
===============
This project's goal is to make a highly customizable keyboard with a bunch of accesibility add-ons, so that **most** people can use it.

File structure:
```
ðŸ“‚ access_kb
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚firmware/     - Code running on the keyboard
|  â”œâ”€ îœ‰ micropython/   * Python implementation for microcontrollers
|  â””â”€ îœ‰ tinyusb/       * USB stack
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚hardware/     - PCB files
|  â””â”€ ðŸ“‚libraries/     * References to KiCAD symbols and footprints 
â””â”€ ðŸ“‚latex/        - Sources used to create the PDF report
   â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚images/        * Various visual resources 
   â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚snippets/      * Relevant pieces of code and configuration
   â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚tex/           * Fragments of the complete writing
   â”œâ”€ î˜• conf.tex       * LaTeX configuration
   â””â”€ ï…œ main.tex       * Wrapper file which joins everything together
```
Firmware
========
The firmware runs [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) using [TinyUSB](https://docs.tinyusb.org/en/latest/) for HID emulation, this implementation was based upon `noobeepi`'s [work](https://github.com/noobee/micropython/tree/usb-hid). My code was made inspired by [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)(C) and [KMK](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware)(CircuitPython, Adafruit's fork of MicroPython)

Hardware
========
The PCB was designed from scratch with KiCAD based on `Sleepdealr`'s [RP2040 design guide](https://github.com/Sleepdealr/RP2040-designguide) and uses some symbol/footprint libraries such as:
- [marbastlib](https://github.com/ebastler/marbastlib) -- Keyboard parts
- [SnapEDA](https://www.snapeda.com/parts/RP2040/Raspberry%20Pi/view-part/) -- RP2040 MCU
